## Introduction

The Data Science Capstone Project is the culmination of the Data Science Specialization offered by IBM. This project allows us to showcase our skills and knowledge gained throughout the specialization by working on a practical and real-world data science problem.

## Project Goal

The primary goal of this capstone project is to demonstrate proficiency in:
- Data acquisition and cleaning.
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization.
- Machine learning model development and evaluation.
- Presentation of results and insights.

## Project Structure

1. **Introduction and Problem Statement**: Provides an overview of the problem we aim to solve and its significance.
   
2. **Data Acquisition and Cleaning**: Explains how data was collected and the preprocessing steps undertaken.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Presents an exploratory analysis of the data, including visualizations and key insights gained.

4. **Model Building**: Details the machine learning model chosen, features, and techniques used for model development.

5. **Results and Evaluation**: Showcases the results obtained from the model and evaluates its performance.

6. **Conclusion and Future Work**: Summarizes the project, insights gained, and proposes potential areas for future improvement.

## Technologies Used

- Python and associated libraries for data analysis and machine learning.
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive data exploration and visualization.
